# intelligent-car-parking-management-system-using-image-processing
Intelligent car parking management system using project is created inorder to overcome the problem face for ordinary parking lots in which lot of space is wasted. The main idea of our project is to accomodate more cars and make time assistance of parking for user.The system consist of camera fitted at entrance and then car image is captured from top angle.
